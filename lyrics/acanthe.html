					<p class="mika">The Parfum of spring has been called upon to rouse me—<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="“To rouse” (目覚める) can mean awaken in the sense of “becoming conscious of something,” i.e. the doll “awakening” to the enlightenment of life." id="fnref:1" aria-expanded="false">1</a></p>
					<p class="shu">Our love long imprisoned within recollections and memories</p>
					<br>
					<p class="shu">Once again, you awaken to the enlightenment of life<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="呼び起こす can mean to wake someone up, but also to cause someone to remember something, or to evoke something within someone that they may have forgotten. This is also why I included “Once again,” to fit with the idea that this has happened before and will happen again, as per the “repeating” of one's love across eternity." id="fnref:2" aria-expanded="false">2</a></p>
					<p class="mika">Something is faintly stirring—</p>
					<p class="valkyrie">I catch a glimpse of hope</p>
					<br>
					<p class="shu">Resurrect</p>
					<p class="mika">My singing voice, dancing on the wind like flower petals</p>
					<p class="shu">My time-worn</p>
					<p class="mika">Feelings are in full, unceasing bloom</p>
					<p class="shu">As fragrance fills the air,</p>
					<p class="mika">Mercy—</p>
					<p class="valkyrie">I yearn for even a drop of it</p>
					<br>
					<p class="mika">While awaiting my decay into obscurity,<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="朽ち can mean decay in the sense of one’s life wasting away and being forgotten with time." id="fnref:3" aria-expanded="false">3</a></p>
					<p class="shu">Adoration and fantasy</p>

					<br>
					<p class="shu">The Lumiere of spring is a steadfast warmth that won't ever vanish</p>
					<br>
					<p class="mika">Passing through the glass, our then-disrupted moment</p>
					<p class="shu">Revolves thrice<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="This line literally means “makes a movement three times,” so the type of movement is vague.

					<p class="shu">Forevermore</p>
					<br>
					<p class="shu">That there is no end to the changing seasons;</p>

					<br>
					<p class="shu">That reminiscent</p>
					<p class="mika">Lingering fragrance—treat it with tenderness,</p>
					<p class="shu">As aforetime's</p>
					<p class="mika">Love had adorned it<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="愛情 refers to romantic love." id="fnref:6" aria-expanded="false">6</a></p>
					<p class="shu">These scars, too,</p>
					<p class="valkyrie">Are proof of us having survived that era</p>
					<p class="mika">Even if you wither away, I will never forget you<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="The withering here refers to the type of decay plants experience as they die, especially due to winter." id="fnref:7" aria-expanded="false">7</a></p>

					<p class="mika">No matter how many times this repeats;</p>
					<p class="valkyrie">No matter if your feelings fade away,</p>
					<p class="shu">I will give you the spring</p>
					<p class="mika">And continue this cycle of love,</p>
					<p class="valkyrie">Each time with a kiss that will breathe life into your heart, for eternity</p>

				<p>※ I use the "I" and "You" pronouns a lot, but there is no actual reference to them in the lyrics. It's simply my interpretation of some of the lines being spoken by the artist or doll in the song's story and directed at the other. Shu represents the artist and Mika the doll, but in most of the lines, they're both just acting as narrators.</p>
