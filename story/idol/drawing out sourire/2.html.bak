			<b>Shu:</b> You don’t need to keep apologizing over and over. I understand the situation.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> If you truly want to make it up to me, hang up the phone and go back there to resolve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hm, that is fine. Well then, I’ll be waiting for you at the café.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (How unfortunate that trouble arose at her work on the day of our Feature Live meeting, of all days.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (Well, I can just read something to pass the time.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (I am also looking forward to eating the round bread at that café for the first time in a while.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (Even though the type of clientele has changed due to the Shuffle Unit project, I hope it won’t be too noisy there.) <sup>[1]</sup>

			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Huh? Isn't that Shu-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Wait, that's you, right, Shu-kun? Why are you ignoring me?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> H-huh? Can you really not hear me? Shu-kun, it's me! It's Tsumugi Aoba~!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...I would prefer it if you didn’t go shouting so loudly in my ear, Aoba.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Ah, you were finally able to notice me...! Thank goodness.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> There is nothing good about it. ...I did not expect to meet you in town like this.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Fufu. I was surprised too. Though I knew you had come back, at least.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Are you heading to ES after this? Or do you have other things to do?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I was on my way to the café that had led to you and I forming a shuffle unit together.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Ahh, the one we promoted as BLEND+...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> But... If I'm not mistaken, I think that café was closed today?
			</p>
			
			<figure>
                <img src="/media/idol/drawing out sourire/drawing out sourire 2-4.jpg">

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...What? I thought that café was open every day?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Yes. Well, that's how it was originally, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> With the concept changing to "a café where you can feel close to ES' new idols," the business model has also changed a little.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> But still, days off are really rare. And it's precisely because they're so rare that I remembered I had a day off today too.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> <i>Sigh.</i> The café is closed and the little girl has trouble at work... It doesn’t bode well for me today.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Anzu-chan is having trouble?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Ah, your concern is unnecessary. It’s nothing she can’t handle.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> But I received word that she wouldn't make it in time for our meeting regarding the Feature Live.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> I see. So it's Shu-kun's turn next, huh?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Then, is that bag in your hand a present for Anzu-chan? I shouldn't expect... a souvenir for me, should I?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Shouldn’t you know that already? Of course not.
			</p>

                <img src="/media/idol/drawing out sourire/drawing out sourire 2-5.jpg">
            </figure>
			
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Uu. I figured~ But I didn't think you would say it quite so bluntly like that...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> And why should you expect to receive anything from me? I have no intention of being close enough to you to give you presents.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Ehh~. I thought we were on good terms, since we formed a shuffle unit together...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> That’s a shock, Shu-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You're a real pain today.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Ugh... If you must have a gift that badly, help yourself to the snacks I left in the Starmony dorms common room.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> There’s a souvenir for everyone at Starmony? It's unusual for you to do something like that, Shu-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I suppose. I travel outside of Japan so frequently. If I had to purchase souvenirs every time, there'd be no end to it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...Some people once helped me pick out presents for my friends in Paris, that's all. <sup>[2]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> It's a bit delayed, but I wanted to thank them for that. Nothing more.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> ...♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...What. I'd prefer you not look at me like that. It's disturbing.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> I was just thinking that you've changed too, Shu-kun. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> No, you’ve always had that kind of personality. It’s just been more obvious recently.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> In any case, I'll take you up on your offer when I get back to Starmony. Thank you very much.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hmph, do as you like.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsumugi:</b> Well then, I have to go too. I'm looking forward to your Feature Live, Shu-kun. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Really, that Aoba never changes...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (Now, I must inform the little girl that we cannot use our usual café for the meeting.)
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Over here, little girl.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I’ve heard more than enough apologies from you. Anyway, I understand the situation, more or less; you are not at fault.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> And so, I will not blame you for this matter.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...Leaving that aside, I am more concerned about your appearance.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> As this is a meeting, it also counts as work. Even if we have known each other since we were in school, you should still be maintaining a level of professionalism around me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...Of course. I know that you hurried over so you wouldn’t keep me waiting.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I’ll give you some time to get yourself sorted out... Hm?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You’re curious about what’s on the table?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> This is a gift for you. It’s a new product from a popular pastry shop in Paris.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I bought it at a Parisian friend’s recommendation. I don’t know if it will be to your tastes, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> "Can I really have it?"
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I bought it for you. Is there any reason you shouldn’t have it?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You are looking after Kagehira, so I am also in your debt. Please take it as a token of my gratitude. <sup>[3]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I have something else for you, too.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> This is an artbook—a compilation of different works that have caught my eye over the past year.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> This Feature Live may be my solo live, but it is essential for us to work together in order to create this stage...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> While I respect your abilities, I do not believe you fully understand the kind of art that I aim to create.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> That is why I am giving you this artbook.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> By knowing what kind of works that I find pleasing, you may gain a greater understanding of my perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> If you do so, you will be able to grasp my ideal stage, won’t you?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Both parties should be able to foresee its actualization.  It’s an important part of any collaboration.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> However, the world of art is not something you can fully comprehend overnight. At the very least, I hope it will broaden your horizons.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You seem to like it. ...Hm, do your best.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> However, you are more enthusiastic than I expected. Well, it’s good to see you in high spirits.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Now then, let’s get started on the Feature Live meeting right away.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hm? What do I want to do for the photo for the brochure?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...Regarding that, how about a photoshoot in Paris?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Even though I come back here from time to time, my main base of operations at the moment is essentially in Paris.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> In which case, it would make sense to take my candids there. Above all, it allows me, Shu Itsuki, to demonstrate my strengths as an artist.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You need to confirm your schedule?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...You can sneak into my group exhibitions with Kagehira, but you’re unable to spontaneously accept my invitations?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> There’s no need to worry. I’ll at least act as your guide over there.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Didn’t I say we are going to work on this stage together? This time, I’ll have you accompany me to the very end.
			</p>

			<b>Shu:</b> To spread the word—so that we may enlighten the entire world on the existence of the artist known as Shu Itsuki.
