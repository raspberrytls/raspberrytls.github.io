			<b>Mika:</b> Sorry t' keep ya waitin', Anzu-chan.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ya weren't waitin' long at all? I'm glad, then.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ah, did'ya get some drinks ready too? Thank ya kindly. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> So what did ya wanna talk with me about? New work?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah? It's Oshi-san's turn fer a Feature Live?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Gotcha~! So I finally get t' see Oshi-san's solo live. I've been lookin' forward to it fer a long time now, so I'm real happy. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Hm? Ya want help comin' up with an idea this time, too?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Now that'cha mention it, when it was time fer Oshi-san's exclusive outfit, ya came t' ask how I would have him dressed.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Anzu-chan, maybe you'll come up with some ideas fer the stage this time too, an' Oshi-san can choose one?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~... I might be puttin' ya out by sayin' somethin' so selfish, Anzu-chan, but...

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Can't ya have Oshi-san make his Feature Live by himself, completely from scratch?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> There wasn't enough time or much of a budget fer the exclusive outfit, right? So we thought up an idea together, an' Oshi-san finished it up.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> 'Course, that was also super pretty.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> It was real excitin' t' see the idea we came up with turn out t' be even more amazin' when left in Oshi-san's hands than I ever coulda imagined.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But... It's cause'a this that I wanna see Oshi-san make his solo live completely on his own, with his own two hands, from start to finish.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Anzu-chan? Will ya do what I'm sayin'?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> There's more time t' spare this time 'round... D'ya also wanna see Oshi-san make his solo live from scratch?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> It’s just a selfish request o’ mine, but is there any chance you’ll hear me out?

			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Oh, of course. If ya run into any kinda mess, I'll help ya out, so just lemme know, okay?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Even though there's a lot more time than before, 'm sure Oshi-san'll have plenty of demands this time, too.

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I know 's a lot t' handle, but please look after Oshi-san. ♪

			<b>Shu:</b> Hello, little girl? I was just looking over the material you sent me for the Feature Live.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> But... Is this all of it? 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You attached the concept materials for the exclusive outfit last time, but they are missing here.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Instead, there is a list of stages that can be recreated based on the scale of previous Valkyrie performances and the planned budget... 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hm? Unlike with the exclusive outfit, we have some time before the Feature Live?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> So rather than do it how we did last time, you opted to consult with me on the kind of solo live I want to perform. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I understand your line of thinking. In other words, I can create the stage as I’d like from scratch.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Fortunately, I have no pressing work or group exhibitions coming up on my agenda. It appears that I’m able to dedicate all of my time to the Feature Live. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...I know that there are limits to funding and time without you reminding me.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> <i>Sigh.</i> Time and money are both inextricably linked to the continuation of my artistic endeavors. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...However, the creation of wonderful art necessitates paying a corresponding price. 
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Knowing this, you still wish to see the Feature Live produced by I, Shu Itsuki?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> If that’s the case, then I am just responding to those feelings. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> We can discuss the details after I return to Japan on the weekend. In the meantime, I’ll put together some ideas. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...Hm? Is there anything else?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Ahh. The shoot for the brochure. I will think of a concept for that too. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Then, I should get back to work.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...What is it? If you have more to say, do so quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> "I hope I can learn a lot from you this time too?"
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hmph. I am telling you this now, but I will not be handholding you through every step.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> If you want to learn, learn from observing. Please be sure not to get in my way.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Okay. I’ll end the call here.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (A Feature Live, huh. Despite all the restrictions, being able to hold a solo live is a valuable thing.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (What’s more, she said that this time, they are willing to accommodate my requests to an extent. I cannot let this incredible opportunity pass me by.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Kakaka. Let’s start coming up with ideas.
			</p>

			<b>Leo:</b> Wahaha! ☆ For some reason, Shu looks so happy~!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Gyaah?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Woah! I wonder when's the last time I've seen Shu so surprised like that?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Ah, it's been a long time since I’ve felt inspiration gushing out like this! Gimme a moment, I'll write it down right now!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Tsukinaga! How long have you been here?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Or rather, if you are here, you should give me a proper greeting! How childish of you to surprise people and then laugh at their reactions!
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Ah~, you used to get angry like that a lot when I first started coming here! Yeah yeah, there’s a nostalgic feel to this melody... ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> As usual, you still don’t listen to a word I say, do you...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Enough of that. I suppose you have no particular reason for coming today, <i>again</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> I did have a reason, though~? I came for some Shu-style inspiration! And now that I’ve got some, I'm satisfied!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Good for you. If you’re done with your business, go home. I want to concentrate on my work.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Is that the live or whatever that you were talking about on the phone just now? I guess your partner is Anzu~?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Somehow, it’s not a live show, but a Feature Live.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Hm~? Have I heard about that somewhere?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Maybe so. Well, if it doesn’t ring a bell, I suppose your turn is yet to come.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...No. In your case, it is more likely that you just forgot.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> To put it simply, it is my solo live.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> So it's not a stage for Michael and Shu, but a stage for Shu alone~! <sup>[1]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> This is great! I can feel so much inspiration coming forth!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> While I’m flattered by your expectations, I am simply pursuing my art as I've always had.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Yeah, and I think that's great. Since it's always interesting to see what you make.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Your work has changed over the past year, and I'm looking forward to seeing how your live will turn out when done all on your own!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Naturally. Like you, I have been influenced in various ways by this foreign land.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I have improved my techniques and expanded my range of expression. This Feature Live will truly be the perfect chance to showcase that.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Yeah. I'm rooting for you, too~
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Well, I'm guessing the hardest part will be Anzu having to work with you, Shu. Since you care so much about all the tiny details.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I cannot allow even the slightest flaw in the creations I bring forth. An artist must be particular about such things.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (...In any case, if any progress is to be made, it will be necessary to communicate with the little girl.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> (Even if it is just for peace of mind, it is best that I do what I can.)
