			<b>Shu:</b> Incidentally, girl, when did you come to start creating things such as lace handkerchiefs? Until now, I have not heard a word of this...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...I see. Are you using your knitting as a reference point for making a costume?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Even though, as a producer, you are a fairly busy person. That is an admirable thing.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> If you'd like...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You want me to teach you how to better knit lace? I don't have much spare time, either, to go out of my way to instruct you, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Well, when we do have time, giving you a little advice would not be an issue.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> This time...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> It appears that you have knitted another lace handkerchief; would you like for me to examine the results?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I see. If it is that much, then there is no problem. I look forward to seeing to what extent you are able to improve this handkerchief.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> This much...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Is that not significant? I consider it to be an excellent thing to endeavor towards self-improvement.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> If you learnt a new skill as a result, I believe that one ought to take pride in their work. Be dignified without reservation.
