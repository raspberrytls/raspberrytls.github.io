			<b>Nazuna:</b> Nevertheless, it's great that you're trying to deliberately exercise on your own, Anzu~
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> As it is, I already get the impression that you're running around everywhere all the time. I don't think that you should be worried about a lack of exercise, Anzu.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Actually, I'm more worried that you'll collapse from overworking.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Work and exercise are different.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Well, of course. Exercising and moving around for work use different muscles...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> However, please make sure to prioritize your physical health even when training, okay? It's no good to push your body past its limits when you're busy, right~?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Proof of my lack of exercise...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Huh? You were only imitating me, and yet you already have light muscle pain?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Ahaha, that definitely might be because of a lack of exercise. It's not good to suddenly exercise too much. That's all for today; let's do our best again tomorrow. ♪
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> Am I too concerned over this?
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Yea~h. I think so, but if you don't think that you're getting enough exercise, then you're probably right...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Well, it's a good thing to do some light training. As long as you don't overdo it and get extra tired, I'm fine with it.
