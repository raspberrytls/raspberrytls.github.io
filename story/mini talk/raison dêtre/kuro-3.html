			<b>Kuro:</b> Oh, that's right. I have something for you, Little Miss.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Here, some cookies. Truth is, I was going to give them to Hasumi and Kanzaki, but... It looks like Danna can't come to today's meeting.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> I'm sorry that it's not exactly a gift of thanks, but... If you'd like, could you take Hasumi's share of them?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> I'm happy.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> I'm glad to hear it. I'm sure those cookies would also be happy if you could eat them.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Next time I'll bring something made especially for you, so please accept it again.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> I'll give my thanks next time.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Hey, hey, that kind of thing would go on forever. I don't need any thanks, Little Miss.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> If you really want, then next time, you can let me know about a clothing exhibition you went to. How's that sound?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> Is that okay?
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Yeah. Eating something that you planned to give to someone else doesn't taste very good. I'll make more that I can give to Hasumi.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> They're amateurish, but it's been taste tested. I hope that you think they're delicious, as well, Little Miss.
