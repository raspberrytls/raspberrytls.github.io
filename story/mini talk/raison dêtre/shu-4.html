			<b>Shu:</b> ...Girl. I've been wondering this for some time: what is inside of that large paper bag?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> You purchased a playing house set from the nearby toy shop? You likely cannot play by yourself, so why would you buy that sort of thing?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...I see. You are going to bring it as a gift for the child actor you'll meet at the next shoot?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Do you think they'll like it?
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Even if you ask me, since I am not that child, I cannot answer that question.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> However, if you chose that item with all of your heart, then it will not be disregarded. I'm sure that sort of sincerity will be conveyed, even to children.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Before this...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I see; you recalled that child actor mentioning that they wanted a playing house set?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> That sort of thoughtfulness for people, regardless of if they are an adult or a child... I suppose you could say that is a virtue of yours.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> This is unexpectedly heavy.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Well, because it is in that large of a paper bag, it is natural that it would weigh that much.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> With that said, if you are having trouble carrying it, it would be good to call for a company car. You have the privilege to do that much, do you not?
