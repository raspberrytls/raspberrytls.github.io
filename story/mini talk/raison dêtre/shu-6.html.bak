			<b>Shu:</b> ...Hm? If you look carefully, it appears that the toy is more than an ordinary mass-produced item. It seems to differ from what is generally distributed.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> I am making my judgement based solely on what I can see of the exterior pattern, as well as the condition of and text on the packaging. I would say it is probable that it was produced overseas, several decades ago.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...This is an unexpectedly meaningful article. It is likely to have value as a collector's item.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Are you interested in it?
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> This toy... Rather than that, I am interested in the toy store that would stock items such as this.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> My apologies, girl, but could you inform me of the location of the toy store afterwards?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> There were even more toys that looked like this.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Oh? What a considerably fascinating toy store— that it has even more similar toys.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> There may be an item I am interested in. I will visit next time.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> To tell you the truth...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Was this the final similar item in stock? That makes sense; I would be more surprised if there were several vintage items like that on display.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> ...No, you do not need to try and give it to me. Since you went through great trouble to choose it as a gift, it would be best if that child could be given it to cherish.
