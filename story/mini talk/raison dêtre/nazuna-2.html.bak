			<b>Nazuna:</b> Speaking of which, you were also working out a bit while watching me train, right, Anzu?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> When I looked at you, I thought you seemed kind of restless, and I laughed a little when you were copying my movements.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> You said that you just wanted to watch and study, but after seeing it, did you also want to do it yourself?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Sorry if I was a bother.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Nah, you weren't in the way, so it's okay~. I just thought it was unusual to see you training.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> You were struggling a little while doing things like sit-ups, but you were hanging in there. ♪
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> So, you noticed.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Of course I'd notice. It was being perfectly reflected in the training room mirror.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Ahaha. Since you tried your very best, I don't think that you need to be embarrassed. ♪
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> That is...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> You feel like you haven't been getting enough exercise lately, so you thought you'd try out the same training as everyone else?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> What, was that it? But, wouldn't the sort of training that we idols do be too much of a burden for you, Anzu?
