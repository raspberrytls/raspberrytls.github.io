			<b>Kuro:</b> I've known Itsuki for a long time now, but... It seems like there's always some kind of trouble around him.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Well, it's not like I can speak for anyone else, either. Since he's my childhood friend, whenever I hear about things like conversation and rumors about him, I get concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Hm? What kind of trouble was I worried about? Well, I could tell you about some stories from our childhood...
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> You both...
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> We had a childhood? Come on, Little Miss. Who do you think we are?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> There was a time when me and Itsuki both were innocent and simple-minded, even if you can't imagine it now.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> I'd like to hear any kind of story.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> I'm kinda lost when told I can share any sort of story, huh. Maybe...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Is it alright if I tell you about how when Itsuki was carefully trying to eat a croissant once, he dropped it and became depressed for a while afterwards?
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> You have a good relationship.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Well, if you think about the old days when we would play games while covered in mud together, our relationship has changed a lot.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Kuro:</b> Still, that undesirable yet unbreakable relationship continues on even now. I think I'd like to have a "good relationship".
