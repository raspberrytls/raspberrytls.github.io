			<b>Nazuna:</b> Since Izumi-chin gave me something really nice, I want to get him something in return.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> I bought green tea bags, ochazuke sets, and boil-in-the-bag side dishes to give to him. I also got seasonings.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> I was told it was plain, but he still accepted it. ♪
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> Seasonings...?
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Yep. They sell soy sauce and miso overseas, too, but the flavor actually differs a bit. He said that Japanese food is more to his taste.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> It's not that big of a deal, but if that's how Izumi-chin can do his best while far away overseas, then I think I made a good choice with my gift. ♪
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT:</b> You're very helpful.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> No, not at all. I just did some research so that he'd like what I give him, is all~?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> I think that I'll do some research regularly, so that I can pick a present using my own taste next time.
			</p>
			<blockquote><p>
			<b>SELECT</b> I think you have good taste.
			</p></blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> Ahaha, Thanks. Actually, it's a bit different from the kind of taste I was hoping for, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nazuna:</b> If you also get something as a gift to someone living abroad, a good choice would be Japanese food that's lightweight and keeps a long time. ♪
