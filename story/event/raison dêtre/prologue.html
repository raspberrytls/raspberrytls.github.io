			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> That is to say, I am <i>still</i> being slighted in regards to my use of a cup phone.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> What ya said, “slighted”, what's that mean? It's gotta kinda charmin' sound to it~ ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> What I mean is, I am still being ridiculed. How do I let these vulgar philistines know that in the distant past—when I was but a student—I had not yet become familiar with modern conveniences such as these?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~, don'tcha think that's a bit different from bein' made fun of? Maybe they jus' think it's funny?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Oh-ho, do you find those two concepts to be distinct? Do you consider your reasoning to be as such: the former is slander, and the latter is a favorable expression?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> W-well, I didn't really think it'd be that complicated.
			</p>
			<p>Why're ya so worried 'bout this, Oshi-san? Weren't we jus' havin' a fun talk about the weird rules we have at Starmony Dorms? Just chattin'?</p>
			<p>Well, y'know~, whenever I'd hang a cup phone from my room, my roommate'd always take notice sayin' somethin' like, “Ah, Kagehira is definitely talking to Oshi-san today.”</p>
			<p>Shouldn'tcha rather be grateful, or happy, or somethin' like that?</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Am I <i>not</i> supposed to take offense to the fact that a <i>cup phone</i> could instantly remind someone of me?
			</p>
			<p>It is undoubtable that the spiteful lot from our home country still, to this day, view me as some hard-to-please, anachronistic, elderly person in need of nursing care.</p>
			<p>Ha! To that I say, the manner in which they are entirely unable to undergo mental development is proof of aging itself!</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> What's that gotta do with me~...? Why're ya <i>actually</i> in a bad mood, Oshi-san?
			</p>
			<p>What's th'matter? Did somethin' bad happen at university?</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hmm. There is nothing in particular—it's been quite peaceful and uneventful. What sort of person do you take me for?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> It's 'cause Oshi-san is <i>Oshi-san</i> that I'm worried!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Are you in any position to be concerned for other people? You've grown much, haven't you?
			</p>
			<p>I see! You are a fully realized human now! You no longer require me to take care of and raise you in various ways. You are capable of walking on your own now, is that it?</p>
			<p>Congratulations, Pinocchio! Aren't you <i>so</i> pleased to have become so accustomed to humanhood!?</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (Nnah~... Oshi-san's been irritated fer a while, after all~... Whenever I'm in a good mood, Oshi-san seems t'get in a bad one.)
			</p>
			<p>(What's he <i>actually</i> mad at, though? Well, <i>I</i> might'a done somethin'.)</p>
			<p>(I really ain't got the foggiest idea...)</p>
			<p>(Even with how busy th'end of the school year is, I went outta my way t'come all the way here to Paris, since Oshi-san said, “I want to talk to you about the future.”)</p>
			<p>(Doin' anythin' but actually tellin' me I'm doin' good, it was when I said I'd be stayin' in Starmony Dorms next year, that he started t'get all irritated like that.)</p>
			<p>(I dunno, maybe Oshi-san's plans were different?)</p>
			<p>(But... since Valkyrie generally only has work back home, it's smarter t'stay there.)</p>
			<p>(I'm different from Oshi-san—there's nothin' in particular I wanna study abroad. 'Sides, I wouldn't be able t'get into the same university as Oshi-san with <i>my</i> brains.)</p>
			<p>(Even so, I wanna live together with Oshi-san. Is sayin' somethin' like that selfish?)</p>
			<p>(I'd be a bother fer the people at Oshisan's place. Would I even have anythin' t'do here?)</p>
			<p>(It's lonely, but... It's annoyin' t'be forced t'be with someone jus' 'cause they're feelin' lonely, ain't it, Oshi-san?)</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Non! Why have your hands come to a stop, Kagehira-kuuun? Did I forget to wind your mainspring?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnaaagh, why're ya callin' me “kun”~? Feelin' like there's distance between us makes me lonely!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Is this not suitable for you? Are you not always far too overly familiar with me to an abnormal extent? Thanks to <i>you</i>, <i>I</i> misjudged the appropriate amount of distance that should be between us!
			</p>
			<p>Owing to that, I became confused and began making earnest preparations for the sake of your new life here! I bowed my head to the landlady, secured a room, and furnished it—I prepared everything to perfection, kakaka!</p>
			<p>Well, it was all in vain in the end! Go on then, laugh at me for being foolish enough to eagerly believe in a falsehood, and superfluously attempt to bring it to reality!</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~...? O-Oshi-san, if that's what'cha really want, then I can go ahead an' start movin' ma stuff over?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> That is not needed <i>nor</i> wanted! I have no idea what came over me. Take the preparations, furniture, and everything else I procured for you back home to sell off for funds to aid in Valkyrie's activities!
			</p>
			<p>Take all the works I made this past year back with you to sell, as well! To a certain extent, I believe their prices will be agreeable—is it not only right to have pride in oneself?</p>
			<p>Our performance at that fateful great war—'SS'—was not very satisfactory...</p>
			<p>We were forced to take part in slapstick comedy and the like, and our reputation suffered as a result.</p>
			<p>In order to eliminate those flaws, let us sell a variety of items to procure funds, so that we may raise the curtain on new artistic ventures.</p>
			<p>In reality, we are not in the proper situation to joyfully anticipate a new life.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> My bad... Oshi-san, I didn't think y'were lookin' forward ta livin' together with me that much.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> With who? To what? What was I looking forward to!?
			</p>
			<p>Do not get carried away with conceit! To begin with, It is <i>your</i> suggestive words and actions that caused my misunderstanding—</p>
			<p>Hm?</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Wh-what is it? Oshi-san...?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Stop that timid, small animal-like behavior! It's annoying!
			</p>
			<p>It is merely a phone call. When guests come, the landlady takes great care not to call me... Perhaps it is some urgent business?</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> A phone call? Ahh, I'll pipe down, then~ ♪
			</p>
			<p>(A-actually, that might'a saved me. I hope it gets rid'a this weird atmosphere.)</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> Hello? Oh, Nii-sama, how unusual is this? Is something wrong?
			</p>
			<p>Yes, yes—it is quite troublesome, isn't it? I am doing well! Didn't I request that you leave me alone? Again, for what reason did—</p>
			<p>—...Huh?</p>
			<p>... ... ...I understand.</p>
			<p>Yes... I'll return home soon.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Wh-what's th'matter? Was that phone call jus' now from yer older brother? What happened?
			</p>

			<b>Shu:</b> It's grandfather...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Hm?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Shu:</b> It seems that early this morning, my grandfather passed away.
