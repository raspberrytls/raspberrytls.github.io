			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...Hello, Mika-chan? What's the matter, have you gotten yourself lost?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Mm-hmm, you're arriving soon? Thank you for going out of your way to tell me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Yes, I've got it. It's fine to take it easy, but be careful, okay?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Anzu-chan, it looks like everyone in Pretty 5 will be here in a bit.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Now that we're finally opening shop, I'm getting nervous.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...What's wrong, Anzu-chan? Let's welcome them with a smile, you said?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Oh dear, did you notice the nervousness on my face?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> A smiling face is the foundation of good customer service. Smile smile... ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> At any rate, Anzu-chan, thank you for coming here on such short notice.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...You say that you'll always rush to help your Onee-chan no matter what?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Ufufu, you told me something nice, didn't you? I can't help but want to give you a big hug.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Everyone in Pretty 5 are the only ones coming to today's pre-opening, so I think I can handle the customer service by myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Still, it's not something I'm used to, so I'm relieved to have someone helping out.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> More than anything, I wanted to give you an early introduction to this limited-time café "Pretty Room".
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...That's right. I've combined "Pretty" and "Tea Room". It's simple, but I like it. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I have a friend who's the manager of a fancy store. It's been a lifelong dream of theirs to open a café.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> They found just the right property, so we decided to open the café for a limited time as a trial run.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I'm involved as an advisor and ambassador. The name of the store was also based on my idea.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> It's a personal activity—or rather, free help—so I don't think it would be good to have any large-scale advertising.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> It's okay to say something like "This is my friend's café", Anzu-chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...Ufufu, that's relieving to hear, Anzu-chan.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Yeah. I'll liven up "Pretty Room" while keeping things in moderation.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> For my friend's dream, I'll do everything in my power to help... ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...Ah. It looks like Mika-chan and the others have arrived. Let's welcome them together, Anzu-chan.

			<b>Arashi:</b> He~llo, welcome ♪ to "Pretty Room".
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I welcome you. Come, come, please come in. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Hello~ Naru-chan, sorry t'keep ya waitin'~
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~? Anzu-chan's here. Looks like yer wearin' the café uniform, but are ya workin' part time?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> ...Ahh, so you're just helping out today?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Those clothes really suit you! It's lovely!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> It's a cute uniform, right? Since it's a pre-opening unveiling event, I asked her to wear it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Hiyori:</b> It's a fantastic uniform that has both good design and functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Hiyori:</b> It looks good on Anzu-chan, but wouldn't it look good on me, too?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> As expected of Tomoe-senpai, you understand the concept. When making the uniform, we aimed to create something that anyone is able to wear.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tori:</b> Hm~m? If I'm not mistaken, were you also involved in the design, Narukami-senpai?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> That's right~ After all, I am the advisor.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> ...Well, that's no good. We've been talking while standing for a long time. Please feel free to take any seat you'd like. I'll bring you water right away.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Oh? Anzu-chan, did you already bring enough water for everyone? Thank you.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Okay, here's the menu. Since it's only the pre-opening, the dishes we can offer are limited.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I hope you enjoy "Pretty Room"... ♪

			<b>Arashi:</b> (...Ah. Everyone in Pretty 5 is immediately advertising it on SNS.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> (There's a lot of comments saying "I'm definitely going." I'm so glad. ♪)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> (Everyone said unanimously that the meals were delicious. I feel like it was a complete success... ♪)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Izumi:</b> ...Naru-kun, what have you been smirking about since a while ago? It's gross.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Well~ I've only been looking at my phone, so excuse me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Ritsu:</b> Let me see, I wonder what Nacchan is looking at... Oh.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Ritsu:</b> Hmm, Tori-kun's SNS? Mikarin and the others are also in the picture.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Since I have the opportunity, I'll advertise it to everyone. Do you remember the "Pretty Room" I was talking about before?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsukasa:</b> Ahh... Is that the CAFÉ you're involved with, Narukami-senpai?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Yes, that's right. Incidentally, I'm its advisor and ambassador... ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> It's finally opening tomorrow, but today we specially invited everyone in Pretty 5.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Izumi:</b> Hmm. Did you call them so that you would receive some publicity?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Izumi-chan, mind your words. Well, I can't deny that it's true.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> After all, I am collaborating free of charge, so that sort of thing is the only way I can advertise.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsukasa:</b> That's right. We are IDOLS. With that title, we need to be careful in regards to how we act publicly.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Tsukasa:</b> If you want to advertise with flair, it's necessary to go through an agency, and you have to pay them. You should proceed with caution.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I understand. After confirming with Anzu-chan, I asked her to collaborate only as a friend.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> I hope to use everyone here as my friend, as well. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Izumi:</b> Eh~ I don't want to go if I'm forced to, you know?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> Wahaha! That's why Sena is a contrarian~
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Leo:</b> I'm interested! Let's go, Naru, lead the way! ☆
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Huh, now?! That's impossible since the store won't open until tomorrow.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Arashi:</b> Jeez, Leo-kun. Listen to me properly, okay?
