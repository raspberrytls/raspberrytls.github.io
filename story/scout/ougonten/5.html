			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~... How'd this kinda thing even end up happenin'?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Cheer up, Mika-nii~chan! Hang in there!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> My bad, Mitsuru-kun. I know I gotta pull myself together, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But I never thought somethin' like this would happen when leavin' it up t' Ran-senpai.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I'm sorry. I didn't expect this either. My apologies, but the result did turn out to be unexpected and a little amusing.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Amusin', huh... I'm seriously worried about it~! I really shouldn'ta left it up t' ya, Ran-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> But didn't you also agree to Nagisa-senpai's strategy, Mika-nii~chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Uuu... I thought it was a good idea when I was jus' listen' to it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...While the trend of Mika-kun as a god was popular on social media, I introduced a plot twist where I appeared as a new god.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...It was a strategy done so that the trend's focus would shift from Mika-kun to myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...When I adopt "God Mode," I'm able to appear in and handle a context where I take the role of a god without feeling out of place.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> In reality, everyone was super excited about Nagisa-senpai's appearance!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> That first post was also written by Nagisa-senpai and went viral on social media, right?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I had made sure that my display name and account couldn't be traced back to me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I would use that account to bring down the god Mika-kun and make preparations for me to take his place as a new god.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Afterwards, I was planning to begin weaving a new tale in which all the fans would regard me as a god in the same manner as when Mika-kun became a god.

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But what happened is jus' that the number of gods grew t' two, yeah~? Why'd it turn out that me an' Ran-senpai're rulin' over the world together like we're friends?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> If I'm gonna be rulin' over the world with anyone, I'd rather it be with Oshi-san!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I'm glad that Nagisa-senpai and Mika-nii~chan have become friends!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I'm also surprised at how unexpectedly powerful the influence of Mika-kun as a god is.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I actually gotta feelin' that it's even more intense than before...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...The existence of adversaries is vital as a component to enliven a story with. Evidently, I was perfectly suited for that role.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Mika-kun and I are ruling the world together peacefully now, but the process to get there was certainly like a battle of the gods.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Fufu. It was exceedingly interesting to see people come up with developments that I never would have thought of.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...In particular, I'll praise the author who wrote about Mika-kun becoming "Ougonten" and scattering gold coins, leading to me nearly drowning in a sea of them.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...If you interpret it as Mika-kun slapping me on the cheek with a wad of bills, it's quite funny... ♪

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Yer as hard t' understand as ever, Ran-senpai. How're ya findin' any of this funny?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Was it not funny? It was certainly a climactic moment when I activated "God Mode" and split the sea of gold coins.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> No, I don't care about that kinda thing. My problem's that we never ended up reachin' any sort'a solution.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I'm sorry about that. Needless to say, I was unable to oust you from the pedestal of godhood, Mika-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Though, if you think about it, the story of the novel this time was started by your fans, Mika-kun. They would never allow a story to be made where you're defeated.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> But in the end, everyone, from Mika-nii~chan's fans to Nagisa-senpai's, got along and enjoyed the story.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Indeed. That was the most unexpected thing. Rather than our fans fighting, they influenced one another and got along well.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...In that sense, I don't think my intervention this time was completely bad.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Well, that's true, but...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Ultimately, this is no more than a temporary trend. If we wait it out, it will die down sooner or later.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Doing various things poorly to try and stop it may simply rouse the public again, just as what happened this time.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I believe the best solution is to quietly watch over the situation without overreacting.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I guess if we just wait fer everyone t' get tired of it, we don't gotta do anythin' unnecessary.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Yea~h. If that's the case, I guess it's fine, but... Sigh.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Mika-nii~chan, are you alright? That was a huge sigh.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Aah, yep. I'm fine, Mitsuru-kun. Thank ya kindly fer worryin' about me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...The fact that all my fans're writin' novels with me as the main character, an' they're all excited about it.

			<b>Mika:</b> If they're happy, I'm happy. Since I think they're doin' it 'cause they love me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But I'm still just'a rookie. Bein' treated like a god jus' makes me feel real uneasy.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I'm not that big a deal. It's like my name is takin' on a life of its own...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Mika-nii~chan...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I kinda get what you're feeling a bit too, Mika-nii~chan.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I've only ever had cool roles, so I've formed an image of myself as this kind of cool person.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> So that's why I thought everyone was wanting that kind of version of myself...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> It's a little like they don't see the real me, so it's kinda lonely.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I feel like sayin' I'm lonely is a lil' different from what it is. But... yer right.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Even then, don'tcha keep gettin' cool roles, Mitsuru-kun? Don'tcha think it's tough?

			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Mika-nii~chan, aren't you also happy that people are writing novels with you as the main character?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> 'S like I said before. I'm lucky t' have people who'll accept me no matter what form I take.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> In that case, it's good if you're treasured like that, Mika-nii~chan!
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> We~ll... I dunno! I don't really get difficult things either!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> But I think the most important thing is that you're happy, Mika-nii~chan!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I think you should enjoy the parts of it that make you happy!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...I see. I kinda understood what ya wanna say, Mitsuru-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I was thinkin' about it all too much, but it might be a good idea t' jus' enjoy what's happenin' at the moment.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Well then, I'll try an' enjoy myself a lil' more, what with me becomin' a god an' all. ♪
