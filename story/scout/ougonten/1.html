			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huff... Whew... Thank ya kindly, Shiratori-kun. Wanna take a breather here fer now?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Yeah, let's. I got a little worn out from the surprising amount of luggage.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Sorry I dragged ya into this.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I was thinkin' about takin' home my personal belongings from the Handicrafts Club before I graduate, but there ended up bein' way more t' carry than I thought.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> No no, I had some free time too. Actually, it was really amazing to see your treasured works of art, Kagehira-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> And while we were going back home together, I got to hear plenty of inside stories about Machina.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> As an idol fan, there couldn't be anything better. ♪ I'm happy as can be!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I'm glad t' hear that. I feel bad that I can't do nothin' to thank ya fer all the help...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Being able to hear stories about you and Machina is already more than enough thanks for me!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Even now when I remember it, I'm still overwhelmed by that fantastical worldview...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ahaha, don't praise me too much. I might accidentally grow a big head with the way yer talkin' about me.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> No way! As far as I'm concerned, I still haven't said enough about it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> That's right! The Machina live was great, but the Test World before that was amazing too!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huh?! Shi-Shiratori-kun, ya know about the Test World?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> No one could know 'bout it unless they were logged into that virtual world.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Ah, I didn't see it personally! I saw a video of it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Someone had saved a video of what happened in the Test World, and it was posted on social media.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> When I found that video, I was frustrated. I wondered why I couldn't see the heroic figures of Valkyrie with my own two eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Itsuki-senpai and Kagehira-senpai at that time... Even now when I remember you, I still can't help but sigh and begin to cry.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> The appearance of you two looking down on everyone from the heavens and bringing about the end of the world is undoubtedly divine!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> The highlight was really the simple-minded Kagehira-senpai who made it rain money like it grows on trees while saying, "Art is an explosion~!"
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> S-so it's spreading around that much?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Yes! I watched that scene so many times that I thought it was going to burn itself into the screen of my phone.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> No, don't look at it! That's where I think I got way too carried away!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ugh... Handin' out money freely like that really was too much. I guess this 's a type of punishment.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> No, no, I actually think it was a good thing! Don't you?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I loved Kagehira-senpai in that scene so much that I couldn't help but share my thoughts on social media.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> The way Kagehira-senpai looked at that time was like glittering money—

			<b>Mitsuru:</b> (Whisper) Mika-nii~chan should have gone into this room. I'll stealthily sneak inside and investigate...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ah, It's Mitsuru-kun. Welcome home~. What's wrong, why're ya sneakin' around like that?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Uwah?! Mika-nii~chan was still in front of the door?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Ah, I'm sorry! Now that you mention it, we've been standing and talking in front of the door this whole time.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~, we're in the way fer anyone who wants t' come in from behind. Sorry, Mitsuru-kun. We must'a scared ya.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I- I'm perfectly fine! I'm going back to my room now, so I hope you guys have fun talking~!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huh– Mitsuru-kun?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...I accidentally made 'im leave. Since he came into the room, I thought he had stuff t' do.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I wonder if I said somethin' that hurt Mitsuru-kun's feelin's?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Hm~m... I think he just got a bit too surprised, don't you think?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> At any rate, talking while standing like this is no good. We'll do what we did to Tenma-senpai again, scaring anyone who comes into the room.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Yeah. I still have t' carry this luggage t' my room too.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> That's right... But before anything else, let's take a break and drink some tea first. It won't take that long to carry the luggage.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Also, I just want to talk with you a bit longer, Kagehira-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I see. Well then, let's make some warm tea first. ♪

			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Whew... That was dangerous. I almost got found out there by Mika-nii~chan.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> But with this, I was able to learn more about Mika-nii~chan! I'll write it down right away.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> "Mika-nii~chan was a kind god who enjoyed standing while talking with friends."
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Hm~m... Just this much isn't enough~.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> All ri~ght, I'll find out even more about Mika-nii~chan's divine side!
