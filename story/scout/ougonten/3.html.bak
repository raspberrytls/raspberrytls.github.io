			<b>Mitsuru:</b> U~hm, at this moment, Mika-nii~chan... Yea~h, writing's pretty hard after all.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (Mitsuru-kun, it looks like yer concentratin' real hard. Like this, even if I move a lil' loudly, I won't be noticed.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (An' even if I don't catch Mitsuru-kun, Ran-senpai will be lyin' in wait at the entrance of the library.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> ...Is this one finished? All right, lemme reread it again!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (At any rate, I'm the one sneakin' up behind Mitsuru-kun this time. It's been the other way 'round 'till now, so this might be kinda interesting...)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (Or maybe it's more like I'm shakin' with nervous energy. I wonder if Mitsuru-kun has been feelin' the same way when followin' me around?)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (Tch, no good, no good! If I think about too much stuff, I'll mess up again.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> (This time, I'm here t' set things straight! Get ready, Mitsuru-kun. Today's the day all our runnin' after each other ends.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Mitsuru-kun! Today, I'm gonna have a chat with ya fer sure—
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Yippee~! I'm finally done~♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> —Gwah?!
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Huh? Mika-nii~chan, what're ya doing here?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Owie... Ya standin' up so suddenly scared me an' I fell right onto my back.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Sorry, Mika-nii~chan. It would've been really bad if you got hurt.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I'm completely fine, so please don't worry 'bout it. I was the one tryna sneak around in the first place...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah~! That's right, I was hidin' in secret so that ya wouldn't get away, Mitsuru-kun!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> ? Mika-nii~chan, do you wanna play hide-and-seek?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Ah, if that's the case, then I have more to write! I gotta hurry and add it!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Huh? Whaddya mean by addin' more? Or actually, why aren't ya runnin' away?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Huh? Why would I wanna run away from you, Mika-nii~chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Oh, 'cause of hide-and-seek? In that case, I want you to count down!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> No, that's not it... Huh?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Apparently, it seems that there was no need to take such measures from the start.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Oh, Nagisa-senpai! Hey there!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Hello. I'm relieved to see that you're as lively as always, Tenma-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Yeah! I'm full of energy today too! Since I finished my book report assignment, I feel really great now. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...So that's why you were in the library. Mika-kun mentioned that it's unusual for you to be here.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Y-yeah. Ya don't seem like the type t' ever stay still. Anyway, that ain't important right now!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Mitsuru-kun, ain'tcha gonna run away from me again today? Oh, an' I'm not sayin' that 'cause I wanna play hide-and-seek.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Hm~m... But if that's the case, then there's no reason for me to run away from you? Since I already finished writing the book report~?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Book report? Does that have somethin' t' do with me?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Yep. I've been watching you and wrote down my thoughts and observations!
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Uhm hu~h? Nn-huhh?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> 'S no use, I don't get it. Whaddya mean by that?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I wonder why Tenma-kun wrote about Mika-kun in his book report. I think you normally write about your thoughts on books you've read.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> At first, I thought about doing that. But no matter what I read, it made me sleepy...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> So I looked online to see if there were any books with idols that I could read, and there was a short story with Mika-nii~chan as the main character!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huh~, fer real? A story where I'm the main character...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nnah? A... story? Where I'm the main character?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Uh, yer jokin', right? There's no way a story like that exists in this world.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> No, there really is. If you look it up online, you'll find it!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...If that story really does exist, why were you investigating the real Mika-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Ehehe... To be honest, I couldn't really read that story either. I only read the first part but still ended up being sleepy!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> That's why I investigated what Mika-nii~chan does on a daily basis and wrote my book report based on that!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> After all, isn't it a story with Mika-nii~chan as the main character? If that's the case, if I write about Mika-nii~chan, then the book report will definitely be good!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I see. If written originally with rigorous research, Tenma-kun's report may certainly become a nonfiction story about Mika-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Can ya hold on a moment? I really can't catch up t' where y'all're at right now...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...By the way, what kind of story is the one featuring Mika-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Lemme see, if I remember correctly, Mika-nii~chan becomes a god and saves the world... or was it a subjugation? It might've been destruction.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I dunno the rest since I only read the beginning, but it was about that kinda thing!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Now 's super unbelievable! Me as a god... How the heck does that kinda thing even happen?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Oh, maybe ya misheard the word "paper"? Or it coulda been "hair"... <sup>[1]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Nope! I can say for sure that you were a very important god! You were a god like in my and Nagisa-senpai's "God Team!"
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I see. I never expected Mika-kun becoming a god. I would also like to read that story.
