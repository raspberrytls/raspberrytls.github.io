			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Fer now, maybe it'd be a good idea t' calm down an' put our thoughts in order?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Lemme see, first of all, Mitsuru-kun has been followin' me around lately 'cause he needed material fer his book report?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> So I didn't do anything t' hurt yer feelin's, right, Mitsuru-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> That's right. Why would you do anything I'd not like, Mika-nii~chan? I haven't done anything to you, have I?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Right away, even jus' knowin' that gives me some peace of mind...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But I found an even bigger problem. What's all this about a novel where I'm a god?!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Tenma-kun might have known about that novel's existence but didn't finish reading it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Yep! If Mika-nii~chan's the main character, I thought it'd be better to write by watching him directly!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I wanted to read about the real Mika-nii~chan, not about him in a book!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Don't say somethin' like that, Mitsuru-kun. Rather than a book report, ain't that more like an observation diary?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Huh~, even though I went through all the trouble to write it...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Just in case, can I see what you wrote?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Sure! It'll definitely become a better report if Mika-nii~chan looks at it too!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Well then, sure. I can read it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...(Silently continues reading.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...(Gradually turns pale.)
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Nna~h! Oh man, I can't look at this! There's way too many embarrassin' things written about me!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> There's no need to be shy over something like that. Even if you slip and fall, you'll still be an elegant god, Mika-nii~chan!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ya wrote everythin' down, even when I fell over...?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Mitsuru-kun, ya should prob'ly write a proper book report, shouldn't ya? If ya just write about me, it won't count as a book report.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Actually, Mitsuru-kun, ya might end up gettin' in trouble with yer teacher. Ya gotta do yer homework properly.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Huh~... I don't want my teacher to get mad. Is this report really no good at all?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ya said it yerself, that ya wrote it without readin' the book. Since it's a book report, ya gotta read an' write about the book properly.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> If you're saying as much, Mika-nii~chan, then I get it...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Thank ya kindly, Mitsuru-kun. Fer now, that's enough about the report. My question is...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...It's that Mika-kun is the protagonist of that novel. I did a bit of searching on my phone.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Getting straight to the point, the novel with Mika-kun as the protagonist is real.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Th-that's gotta be a mistake. Is it really...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Although I called it a novel, it's just an ordinary derivative work. It doesn't mean it's been published physically or anything like that.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> A derivative work... Nnah~, so someone is writing a novel with me as the main character on their own accord?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Yes. Rather than a specific individual, it seems that they're mainly being written by your fans, Mika-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Why would my fans... start doin' that all'a sudden?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Well. The story surrounding the circumstances is rather complex.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...First of all, it seems that it all began following an incident in a place called the "Test World." Do you happen to know anything about it?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...At th' moment, I got no clue except fer one thing.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I'm having difficulty understanding what it means, but for the time being, I'll simply tell you what I've found from reading.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...The inciting incident was your behavior, Mika-kun, when you appeared in the "Test World" as "The Mechanical God."
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...It then seems that you scattered around and gave away a large amount of money freely. That's the moment that it all began.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> So it really was that! I knew it'd start a right awful flame war afterwards fer sure. I really got way too carried away, 'm such an idiot~!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Hu~h? But isn't a flame war a bad thing? You didn't start one, did you, Mika-nii~chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> If anything, I'd say everyone was more like, "Mika-nii~chan is so cool!" I got the feeling that everyone was really excited.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...I would agree with that. It seems that this derivative novel has also grown to be a relay novel created as a result of fans talking about their thoughts together on social media. <sup>[1]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...And so that novel, which was only on social media, was summarized in a news article on the internet. As a result, it became somewhat of a hot topic.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> A-ain't that a bit of a weird way fer a novel t' come about?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...It seems that creating relay novels on bulletin boards is not that unusual, after all.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Fufu. Nevertheless, what all of those fans think about you is very interesting, Mika-kun.
			</p>

			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Mika-kun, who strewed about a large amount of money while saying, "Art is an explosion~☆" is said to transform into a dragon king called "Ougonten," who will bring forth a new world. <sup>[2]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I'm not even human anymore?! Not only that, but with such an exaggerated name like "Ougonten"...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Uu, I was all prepared fer people t' hate me, but on the other hand, there's no way I could'a been ready fer that kinda worship.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...It is natural that you, being put and deified into that position without expecting it, would be unprepared for it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...A god exists on an absolute, elevated plane that is above what any one person is capable of attaining.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> That sorta impressive existence ain't like me at all. 'S like I'm bein' asked t' do somethin' I can't live up to, so I feel a lil' awkward...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...If that's the case, I have a good plan in mind to bring this trend under control.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Fer real? 'S not gonna be underhanded or nothin', right?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Nagisa:</b> ...Don't worry. I promise that no one will be hurt with this method.
			</p>

				A relay novel is essentially a story that's written collaboratively by multiple people. Someone continues writing for a few sentences where the previous person left off and then hands it to the next person.
			</li>
			<li>
				The title "Ougonten," 「黄金天」, means "God of Gold." 黄金 is gold (and can also mean money). 天 usually means "heaven," but in this case, it's another way to refer to a god. The title itself is very extravagant-sounding.
