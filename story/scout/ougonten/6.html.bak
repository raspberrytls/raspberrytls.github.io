			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I'm back~! There's freshly baked bread waiting for me!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Ufufu. There was a lot of tasty-looking bread. I'm looking forward to having some now myself... ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I'm glad the bakery back there had a lot to choose from. I might go there from now on. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Ehehe, I'm happy you liked it. I'm glad I invited you, Ai-chan!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> You bought a lot of bread, Tenma-senpai, but will you be able to eat that much?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> It's fine! I'd rather eat a lot. After all, this is my reward for working so hard on writing my book report!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Book report, huh? Now that you mention it, I got assigned some homework today too.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> What did you read about, Tenma-senpai?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> I read a short story Hajime-chan picked out for me. I wanted one with the simplest contents possible.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Hmm... Shino-senpai chose your book?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I wonder if Shino-senpai would be able to recommend some books for me too if I ask him. I'll talk with him in a bit. ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> More importantly, Ai-chan, let's hurry up and eat our bread. It's gonna get cold!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Alright. Before eating, I'll make some tea. ♪ If we're drinking it with bread, I'll go with black tea for sure.

			<b>Mika:</b> Ah, it's Mitsuru-kun an' Shiratori-kun. I'm back~
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Mika-nii~chan! Welcome back~!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Would you like to have some tea with us, Kagehira-senpai? We've got some tasty bread too.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ya sure? I'll have some too if ya got it. There's somethin' I want y'all t' see.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> You wanna show us something? What is it, I'm curious!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I think it's inside my bag... Ah, found it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> What do y'all think about this?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Way too cool! This outfit drawing is so cool!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> This is a rough design of the outfit, right? Uwah, it's the best to get to see your designs freshly-made like this, Kagehira-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> And this outfit is something new that hasn't been seen from Valkyrie before...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Is there any chance that this outfit will be used in Valkyrie's next live?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ah, sorry fer gettin' yer hopes up. This outfit ain't gonna be worn fer a live. This is jus' somethin' I drew while takin' a breather.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> There was this novel from the other day. I came up with a good design based on th' story, so I thought I'd draw it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> A novel? What's it about?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> You mean the story where you became a god, right, Mika-nii~chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Huh?! What do you mean, Kagehira-senpai became a god?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ahaha... Actually, a novel where I was turned into a god went viral online.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> That kind of novel exists?! Uwah, I must've missed it!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ahaha, well, it's a derivative work written by fans.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I tried readin' it too. But it was real embarrassin' fer me t' be treated like a god like that.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Seriously, why'd they gimme an exaggerated name like "Ougonten" an' turn me into a golden dragon?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> What kinda train of thought d'ya gotta have t' come up with somethin' like turnin' me into a dragon?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Huh, Kagehira-senpai as a golden dragon...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> And the golden dragon is called "Ougonten"...?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> What's th' matter, Shiratori-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Umm, hold on a moment, please. There's something I really need to look up...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> ...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Ai-chan, what's wrong?! You turned super pale. Maybe you're sick?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> No, it's just that I noticed something kinda bad a tad too late...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Umm, so Kagehira-senpai became a dragon named "Ougonten"...?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> That's right, but what's really troublin' ya?
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> —Kagehira-senpai, I'm sorry!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Th-that is... I was probably the one to start calling you "Ougonten," Kagehira-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huh?! Then were you also the one who wrote the novel that turned me into a god, Shiratori-kun?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I didn't write the novel! All I did was post my thoughts from watching "The Mechanical God" on social media!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> At that moment, you looked too divine, Kagehira-senpai. The money that you scattered around looked just like the scales of a dragon...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> And I got so excited that I thought, "He's the Dragon God~!" and named you "Ougonten."
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> S-so that's what happened. By the way, why "Ougonten?" 'S such a fancy an' exaggerated name.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Well, when talking about a god of money, doesn't it remind you of Daikokuten? "Ougonten" is a bit of a pun on that. <sup>[1]</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Since at that moment, you were glittering so much with all of that money, Kagehira-senpai!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Come t' think of it, ya said somethin' similar when ya were talkin' about yer thoughts before, Shiratori-kun.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I see. So what ya posted then is how it all started.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> Yes. So... I'm very sorry if it made you feel uncomfortable!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Ya don't gotta apologize like that. I don't mind anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> R-really?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Yep. It's exactly because of yer words, Shiratori-kun, that I was able t' draw this outfit design.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> I've gotten a lotta inspiration an' thought up plenty of creative ideas~ ♪
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I'm glad~. I was wondering what I would do if I was causing trouble for you, Kagehira-senpai...
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Hey hey, Mika-nii~chan. Why don't you show that outfit design to Anzu-nee~chan?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> Huh, to Anzu-chan? But I jus' drew this design fer fun while takin' a breather.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> But it's such a good design, it'd be kind of a waste to leave it as is!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> That's right! You showed the design to us because you wanted someone to see it, right?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> ...Yeah. Yer right, maybe it would be good t' at least show it off.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mika:</b> But if I show Anzu-chan, there's some parts I wanna add a lil' more detail to first. If I don't improve the quality, I won't even be able t' show Oshi-san.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Mitsuru:</b> Woah, as expected of Mika-nii~chan. That outift is still gonna be cool-looking, right?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Aira:</b> I'm excited to see what the design will turn out to be. ♪ Please, you have to show me when it's done.
